## 📖 About

This document summarizes **core Git concepts and workflows**, focusing on **intent, structure, and decision-making** rather than command memorization. Understanding the "why" behind Git operations builds stronger mental models than memorizing syntax.

---

## 1. Git Workflow (Mental Model)

Git operates through **three primary states:**

### States

**Working Directory**
- Where files are created and modified
- Untracked and unstaged changes live here

**Staging Area**
- Where selected changes are prepared for commit
- Intentional selection of what to record

**Repository**
- Where changes are permanently recorded as commits
- Immutable history

### Core Flow

Every meaningful Git action respects this flow:
```
modify → stage → commit
```

**Key Insight:** Git is about intentional state transitions, not arbitrary commands.

---

## 2. Core Commands (Conceptual Purpose)

Each Git command represents a **state transition:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `add` | Intentionally select changes for staging |
| `commit` | Create an immutable snapshot |
| `push` | Publish local commits to remote repository |
| `pull` | Fetch and merge remote changes |
| `merge` | Integrate divergent histories |
| `stash` | Temporarily store uncommitted work |
| `pop` | Reapply stashed changes |

**Key Takeaway:**  
Git is fundamentally about **state management, not commands.**

---

## 3. Branching Strategy (Why Branches Exist)

Branches enable:
- ✅ Parallel development
- ✅ Safe experimentation
- ✅ Isolation of features and fixes

### Common Workflow

**`main`** — Stable, production-ready code  
**`feature/*`** — Isolated development work

**Rule:** Branches should only be merged when the work is **stable and reviewed.**

---

## 4. Pull Requests (Collaboration Layer)

A Pull Request serves as:
- 📋 A review checkpoint
- 💬 A discussion space
- 🚦 A quality gate before merging

**Even in solo projects**, Pull Requests enforce discipline and improve code quality.

---

## 5. Tags and Releases

**Tags** mark important commits (e.g., `v1.0.0`)  
**Releases** package tagged commits for distribution

### Used For:
- Versioning
- Rollbacks
- Professional software delivery

---

## 6. Merge Conflicts (Reality of Team Work)

Merge conflicts occur when:
- The same lines are modified differently
- Git cannot automatically resolve intent

**Rule:**  
> Conflicts are not errors — they are **decisions that require human judgment.**

---

## 7. Forking vs Cloning

**Clone**  
Creates a local copy of a repository

**Fork**  
Creates an independent copy of another repository at the platform level (e.g., GitHub)

**Insight:** Forking is the foundation of **open-source contribution workflows.**

---

## 8. Cherry-Pick (Precision Tool)

**Cherry-pick** applies a specific commit from one branch to another.

**Warning:**  
This is a powerful but **risky tool**. Improper use can lead to:
- Duplicated history
- Maintenance issues
- Confusion in commit lineage

Use only when necessary and with clear intent.

---

## 💡 Core Philosophy

### Understanding Over Memorization

Git is not about memorizing commands.  
Git is about understanding:
- **State management**
- **Intentional transitions**
- **History preservation**
- **Collaboration patterns**

### Mental Model First

Before running a command, ask:
1. What state am I in?
2. What state do I want to reach?
3. What transition gets me there?

This approach builds **intuition and confidence** far better than command lists.

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intent matters** | Every action should be deliberate |
| **History is sacred** | Once committed, treat with care |
| **Branches are cheap** | Use them liberally for isolation |
| **Merges are decisions** | Human judgment required |
| **Collaboration needs structure** | PRs and reviews enforce quality |
