## 📖 Overview

Today I continued working on **"A Silent Place,"** a visual novel project exploring a magical open world where innocent, regretful, and sad people gather. The world is hosted by **Jessy**, who was once trapped herself, and the narrator meets **Joshua**, who wants everyone set free.

Alongside Ren'Py development, I revisited **core JavaScript fundamentals** by building small projects step by step to strengthen event handling and DOM manipulation skills.

---

## 🎮 What I Worked On (Ren'Py)

**Story Development:**
- ✅ Designed and structured Act 1 and Act 2
- ✅ Wrote dialogue-heavy scripts with clear narrative flow
- ✅ Managed multiple characters and narrator dialogue
- ✅ Organized assets (backgrounds, sprites, audio) properly

**Technical:**
- ✅ Focused on clean indentation and readable scripts
- ✅ Tested scene transitions and story progression
- ✅ Maintained proper label structure for branching

---

## 💻 What I Worked On (JavaScript)

**Fundamentals Practice:**
- ✅ Revisited DOM manipulation
- ✅ Practiced event handling and event listeners
- ✅ Built small practice projects step by step

**Projects Built:**
- **To-Do App** — Add, delete, and manage tasks
- **Counter App** — Increment, decrement, and reset functionality
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** — Theme switching with state management

**Development Approach:**
- ✅ Implemented features incrementally instead of all at once
- ✅ Observed how unfinished logic introduces bugs
- ✅ Modified scripts iteratively to fix edge cases

---

## 📚 What I Learned

### Ren'Py Insights
- ✅ Managing multiple acts requires clear structure and labels
- ✅ Story-driven scripting benefits from planning before coding
- ✅ Asset organization becomes critical as projects grow
- ✅ Writing VN scripts is both logical and creative
- ✅ Clean indentation prevents unnecessary debugging

### JavaScript Insights
- ✅ Event listeners are the backbone of interactive UI
- ✅ Small changes can introduce bugs if state isn't handled properly
- ✅ Feature-by-feature development makes debugging easier
- ✅ DOM-based projects improve understanding of real-world UI behavior
- ✅ Revisiting fundamentals strengthens long-term confidence

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Narrative logic and code logic share similar structure** — both benefit from clear organization
- **Incremental development prevents chaos** — build feature by feature
- **Debugging is easier when features are isolated** — single responsibility principle applies
- **Mixing creative work (VN) with technical practice (JS)** keeps learning engaging and balanced

---

## 🧠 Reflection

Today reinforced the importance of **structure, patience, and iteration.**

Whether writing a visual novel or building JavaScript features, **breaking problems into smaller parts** made the process smoother and more enjoyable.

**Progress comes from focused, incremental work—not rushing to completion.**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Ren'Py:**
- [ ] Continue refining Act 2 dialogue
- [ ] Test branching paths and endings
- [ ] Polish asset integration

**JavaScript:**
- [ ] Build more complex DOM projects
- [ ] Practice state management patterns
- [ ] Move toward mini-app development
