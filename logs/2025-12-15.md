# 📅 2025-01-15 — Visual Novel (Day 2) & JavaScript Fundamentals Revisited

## Overview
```
✅ Today I continued working on a second visual novel project titled “A Silent Place.”

✅ The concept revolves around a magical open world where innocent, regretful, and sad people end up—not because they are trapped, but because they are gathered.

✅ The world is hosted by Jessy, a girl who was once trapped herself and now plays a role in keeping others there. The narrator meets Joshua, a character who does not pretend or manipulate, but instead wants the narrator to set everyone free.

✅ Alongside Ren’Py work, I also revisited core JavaScript fundamentals by building small projects step by step to better understand event handling, DOM manipulation, and potential bugs.
```
## What I Worked On (Ren’Py)
```
✅ Designed and structured Act 1 and Act 2 of the visual novel

✅ Wrote dialogue-heavy scripts with clear narrative flow

✅ Managed multiple characters and narrator dialogue

✅ Organized assets (backgrounds, sprites, audio) properly

✅ Focused on maintaining clean indentation and readable scripts

✅ Tested scene transitions and story progression
```
## What I Worked On (JavaScript)

✅ Revisited DOM manipulation

✅ Practiced event handling and event listeners

✅ Built small practice projects:

```
To-Do App

Counter App

Dark/Light Mode Toggle
```
✅ Implemented features step by step instead of all at once

✅ Observed how unfinished logic can introduce bugs

✅ Modified scripts iteratively to fix edge cases

## What I Learned (Ren’Py)
```
✅ Managing multiple acts requires clear structure and labels

✅ Story-driven scripting benefits from planning before coding

✅ Asset organization becomes critical as the project grows

✅ Writing VN scripts is both logical and creative

✅ Clean indentation and spacing prevent unnecessary debugging  
```
## What I Learned (JavaScript)
```
✅ Event listeners are the backbone of interactive UI

✅ Small changes can introduce bugs if state is not handled properly

✅ Feature-by-feature development makes debugging easier

✅ DOM-based projects improve understanding of real-world UI behavior

✅ Revisiting fundamentals strengthens long-term confidence
```
## Key Takeaways
```
✅ Narrative logic and code logic share similar structure

✅ Incremental development prevents chaos

✅ Debugging is easier when features are isolated

✅ Mixing creative work (VN) with technical practice (JS) keeps learning engaging
```
## Reflection
Today reinforced the importance of structure, patience, and iteration.

Whether writing a visual novel or building JavaScript features, breaking problems into smaller parts made the process smoother and more enjoyable.
