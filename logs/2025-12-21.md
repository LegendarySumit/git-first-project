## 📖 Overview

Today was dedicated to practicing **core array-based concepts in Data Structures**, with an **exam-focused mindset**. The work involved understanding how arrays are stored in memory, how addresses are calculated, and how specialized representations like sparse matrices optimize space.

The focus was on **logic, formulas, and correctness**, rather than just theory.

---

## 📘 Topics Practiced

### 🔹 Array Operations

**Core Operations:**
- **Traversal** — Visiting each element
- **Insertion** — Adding elements at specific positions
- **Deletion** — Removing elements
- **Searching** — Finding elements
- **Updating** — Modifying element values

Emphasis was placed on **index-based access** and how operations affect **time complexity**.

### 🔹 Array Address Calculation

Practiced calculating memory addresses using formulas for:

**One-Dimensional Array:**
- Address calculation using:
  - Base address
  - Index
  - Size of data type

**Formula:**
```
Address = Base Address + (Index × Size of element)
```

**Two-Dimensional Array:**
- **Row-major order**
- **Column-major order**
- Understood how memory layout differs in both cases
- Solved numerical problems based on given base address and element size

### 🔹 Sparse Matrix

**What I Practiced:**
- Understood what a sparse matrix is (matrix with mostly zero elements)
- Learned why sparse matrices are used (space optimization)
- Practiced:
  - Identifying sparse matrices
  - Representing them using **triplet form**:
    - Row
    - Column
    - Value
- Focused on **space optimization benefits**

### 🔹 Multidimensional Arrays

**Practice Areas:**
- Working with 2D arrays
- Basic indexing and traversal
- How multidimensional arrays are mapped into linear memory
- Row-wise vs column-wise storage concepts

---

## 🛠️ Work Breakdown

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Arrays** | Core operations and indexing |
| **Memory** | Address calculation formulas |
| **Matrices** | Sparse matrix representation |
| **DSA Practice** | Exam-oriented problem solving |

---

## ✅ What I Learned / Reinforced

- ✅ **Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations**
- ✅ **Address calculation depends on storage order** (row-major vs column-major)
- ✅ **Sparse matrices save memory** when zero elements dominate
- ✅ **Multidimensional arrays are internally linear in memory**
- ✅ **Formula clarity is critical for exams** — precision over speed

## 📐 Key Formulas

### 1D Array Address Calculation
```
Address(A[i]) = Base + (i × size)
```

### 2D Array (Row-Major Order)
```
Address(A[i][j]) = Base + [(i × columns + j) × size]
```

### 2D Array (Column-Major Order)
```
Address(A[i][j]) = Base + [(j × rows + i) × size]
```

### Sparse Matrix Space Saving
```
Space saved = Total elements - Non-zero elements
```

## 🧠 Reflection

Today's practice reinforced the importance of **precision in logic and formulas**. Array address calculation and sparse matrix representation are concepts that demand **accuracy rather than speed**.

Repeated numerical practice helped build confidence for exam scenarios.

**This was a solid fundamentals-heavy day.**

> **Fundamentals tested today build confidence tomorrow.**

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Immediate Practice:**
- [ ] Practice array programs in C/Java
- [ ] Solve more address calculation problems
- [ ] Revise time complexity of array operations

**Upcoming Topics:**
- [ ] Move to linked list basics
- [ ] Practice stack and queue operations
- [ ] Solve previous year DSA questions
