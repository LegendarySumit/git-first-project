## 📖 Overview

Today was a **low-intensity revision day**, focused on revisiting **basic data structure terminology and definitions**. No new implementation or problem-solving was done. The goal was purely **conceptual clarity for examinations**.

This session was about **reinforcing fundamentals** rather than learning new material.

## 📘 Data Structures — Basics Revisited

### 🔹 What Is Data

- **Data** is a collection of facts, values, or information
- It can be processed, stored, and manipulated by a computer
- Data is the raw input on which algorithms operate

### 🔹 Types of Data

**Primitive Data:**
- `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
- Stores single values
- Built-in data types

**Non-Primitive Data:**
- Arrays, structures, classes, files
- Can store multiple values or complex data
- User-defined or composite types

### 🔹 What Is a Data Structure

- A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data
- Enables **efficient access and modification**
- Used to optimize **time and space complexity**

### 🔹 Common Properties (Exam Perspective)

**Key Properties:**
- Organization of data
- Relationship between data elements
- Operations performed on data:
  - **Insertion**
  - **Deletion**
  - **Traversal**
  - **Searching**
- Memory usage
- Efficiency (time and space complexity)

> **Note:** These points commonly appear in definition-based exam questions.

## 🛠️ Work Breakdown

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Concept Revision** | Basic DS definitions |
| **Exam Prep** | Important terminology & properties |
| **Theory Focus** | No implementation today |
| **Maintenance** | Mental refresh of fundamentals |

---

## ✅ What I Reinforced

- ✅ Clear definition of data vs information
- ✅ Classification of data types (primitive vs non-primitive)
- ✅ Purpose and importance of data structures
- ✅ Key properties often asked in exams
- ✅ Common operations on data structures

---

## 🧠 Reflection

**Not every day needs heavy coding.** Today was about **accuracy and recall**, which is essential for examinations.

Revisiting basic definitions helped:
- Reinforce conceptual clarity
- Reduce risk of confusion during written answers
- Build confidence for exam-style questions

This kind of revision supports **stronger performance later** when solving problems.

> **Revision is progress. Clarity beats speed in exams.**

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Immediate:**
- [ ] Revise classification of data structures (linear vs non-linear)
- [ ] Practice short exam answers (2–5 markers)
- [ ] Review common exam question patterns

**Upcoming:**
- [ ] Move to arrays and linked lists basics
- [ ] Practice implementation problems
- [ ] Solve previous year exam questions

## 📊 Session Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Focus Type** | Conceptual Revision |
| **Topics Covered** | Data types, DS definitions, properties |
| **Implementation** | None (theory only) |
| **Exam Readiness** | Improved terminology clarity |
