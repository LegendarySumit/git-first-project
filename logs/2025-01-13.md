# Git Concepts — High-Level Overview

This document summarizes core Git concepts and workflows, focusing on intent, structure, and decision-making rather than command memorization.

## 1. Git Workflow (Mental Model)

```
Git operates through three primary states:

Working Directory
Where files are created and modified.

Staging Area
Where selected changes are prepared for commit.

Repository
Where changes are permanently recorded as commits.

Every meaningful Git action respects this flow:
modify → stage → commit.
```

## 2. Core Commands (Conceptual Purpose)

```
Each Git command represents a state transition:

add — intentionally select changes

commit — create an immutable snapshot

push — publish local commits to a remote repository

pull — fetch and merge remote changes

merge — integrate divergent histories

stash — temporarily store uncommitted work

pop — reapply stashed changes

Key takeaway:
Git is fundamentally about state management, not commands.
```

## 3. Branching Strategy (Why Branches Exist)

```
Branches enable:

Parallel development

Safe experimentation

Isolation of features and fixes

Common workflow:

main — stable, production-ready code

feature/* — isolated development work

Branches should only be merged when the work is stable and reviewed.
```

## 4. Pull Requests (Collaboration Layer)

```
A Pull Request serves as:

A review checkpoint

A discussion space

A quality gate before merging

Even in solo projects, Pull Requests enforce discipline and improve code quality.
```

## 5. Tags and Releases

```
Tags mark important commits (e.g., v1.0.0)

Releases package tagged commits for distribution

They are used for:

Versioning

Rollbacks

Professional software delivery
```

## 6. Merge Conflicts (Reality of Team Work)
```

Merge conflicts occur when:

The same lines are modified differently

Git cannot automatically resolve intent

Rule:
Conflicts are not errors — they are decisions that require human judgment.
```

## 7. Forking vs Cloning
```

Clone — creates a local copy of a repository

Fork — creates an independent copy of another repository at the platform level (e.g., GitHub)

Forking is the foundation of open-source contribution workflows.
```

## 8. Cherry-Pick (Precision Tool)

```
Cherry-pick applies a specific commit from one branch to another.

This is a powerful but risky tool.
Improper use can lead to duplicated history and maintenance issues.
