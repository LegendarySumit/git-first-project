## 📖 Overview

Today I started learning **Ren'Py** and began building my first visual novel game. This was my first hands-on exposure to a **story-driven game engine**, combining scripting, asset management, and narrative flow into a single project.

Despite some initial friction, the overall experience was engaging and surprisingly fun.

---

## 🎮 What I Worked On

**Setup & Exploration:**
- ✅ Installed and explored the Ren'Py engine
- ✅ Understood the basic project structure
- ✅ Wrote my first Ren'Py script using `.rpy` files

**Assets & Testing:**
- ✅ Added characters, backgrounds, and audio assets
- ✅ Ran and tested the game using the Ren'Py launcher
- ✅ Organized assets into proper folders

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

**Indentation Errors:**
- Faced multiple errors due to incorrect indentation
- Learned that Ren'Py (like Python) is **strictly indentation-sensitive**
- Minor spacing mistakes can break script execution entirely

**Asset Management:**
Managing different asset types required discipline:
- Background images
- Character sprites
- Music and sound effects

**Key Learning:** Keep assets organized and consistently named from the start.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

**Ren'Py Scripting:**
- ✅ Ren'Py scripting is simple but strict
- ✅ Visual novels rely heavily on:
  - Clean structure
  - Readable scripts
  - Proper asset organization
- ✅ Story scripting, scene control, and dialogue flow feel natural once basics click

**Technical Skills:**
- ✅ Debugging indentation issues improved attention to detail
- ✅ Asset management discipline prevents future headaches
- ✅ Script organization matters for scalability

---

## 💡 Why This Was Interesting

Writing the script and seeing:
- ✅ Characters appear on screen
- ✅ Backgrounds change with scenes
- ✅ Music play at the right moment

Made the development process feel **creative, not mechanical.**

This is very different from standard web development and opens up a **new way of thinking about software and storytelling.**

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

**Typical Ren'Py Project:**
```
game/
├── script.rpy              # Main story script
├── characters.rpy          # Character definitions
├── images/
│   ├── bg_room.png        # Background images
│   └── hero_happy.png     # Character sprites
├── audio/
│   ├── theme.mp3          # Background music
│   └── click.wav          # Sound effects
```

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- ✅ **Indentation discipline matters** — one space can break everything
- ✅ **Asset naming and structure save time later** — be consistent from day one
- ✅ **Small scripts can create rich interactive experiences** — narrative power
- ✅ **Ren'Py is beginner-friendly but still powerful** — low floor, high ceiling

---

## 🧠 Reflection

This was my **first step into game scripting and narrative-driven development.**

The learning curve was real, but the **feedback loop was rewarding.** Seeing characters come to life and hearing music sync with scenes made the technical challenges worth it.

**I plan to continue expanding this project and refining my scripting style.**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- [ ] Expand the story with more scenes
- [ ] Add character expressions and variations
- [ ] Implement branching dialogue choices
- [ ] Refine asset organization system
- [ ] Study advanced Ren'Py features (variables, conditions, menus)
