# 📅 2025-01-14 — Ren’Py & Visual Novel Development

## Overview

Today I started learning Ren’Py and began building my first visual novel game. This was my first hands-on exposure to a story-driven game engine, combining scripting, asset management, and narrative flow into a single project.

Despite some initial friction, the overall experience was engaging and surprisingly fun.

## What I Worked On

Installed and explored the Ren’Py engine

Understood the basic project structure

Wrote my first Ren’Py script using .rpy files

Added characters, backgrounds, and audio assets

Ran and tested the game using the Ren’Py launcher

## Challenges Faced

Faced multiple errors due to incorrect indentation

Learned that Ren’Py (like Python) is strictly indentation-sensitive

Minor spacing mistakes can break script execution

## Asset Management

Managing different asset types required discipline:

Background images

Character sprites

Music and sound effects

Learned the importance of keeping assets organized and consistently named

## What I Learned

Ren’Py scripting is simple but strict

Visual novels rely heavily on: Clean structure, Readable scripts, Proper asset organization, Story scripting, scene control, and dialogue flow feel very natural once the basics click.

Debugging indentation issues improved my attention to detail

## Why This Was Interesting

➜ Writing the script and seeing:

➜ Characters appear

➜ Backgrounds change

➜ Music play at the right moment made the development process feel creative, not mechanical.
This is very different from standard web development and opens up a new way of thinking about software and storytelling.

Folder Structure (Typical Ren’Py Project)

```
game/
├── script.rpy
├── characters.rpy
├── images/
│   ├── bg_room.png
│   └── hero_happy.png
├── audio/
│   ├── theme.mp3
│   └── click.wav
```

## Key Takeaways

✅ Indentation discipline matters

✅ Asset naming and structure save time later

✅ Small scripts can create rich interactive experiences

✅ Ren’Py is beginner-friendly but still powerful

## Reflection

This was my first step into game scripting and narrative-driven development.
The learning curve was real, but the feedback loop was rewarding. I plan to continue expanding this project and refining my scripting style.
