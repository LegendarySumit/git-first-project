## 📖 Overview

Today was focused on **deepening my understanding of Java fundamentals** and continuing **documentation polish** on older repositories using VS Code. The learning was theory-heavy but concept-oriented, aimed at understanding **how and why Java works** rather than just memorizing syntax.

---

## ☕ Java — Fundamentals Deep Dive

### 📘 Topics Covered

**Scanner Class & Input Handling**

- Understood the purpose of the `Scanner` class
- Learned how a new Scanner object is created:
```java
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```
- Explored how input streams work in Java
- Learned how `next()` reads the next token (space-delimited)
- Understood the difference between `next()` and other input methods

**Java Input & Output Streams**

- **`System.in`**
  - Standard input stream
  - Used for taking input from the keyboard

- **`System.out`**
  - Standard output stream
  - Used for displaying normal program output

- **`System.err`**
  - Standard error stream
  - Used for error messages and debugging

**Key Insight:** Separating output and error streams is useful in real applications for debugging and logging.

**Type Casting**

- Understood **implicit (widening)** type casting
- Understood **explicit (narrowing)** type casting
- Learned when and why casting is required
- Recognized potential data loss during narrowing conversions

**Variables in Java**

Learned the meaning, scope, and usage of:

- **Local Variables**
  - Declared inside methods or blocks
  - Accessible only within that scope

- **Instance Variables**
  - Belong to an object
  - Each object has its own copy

- **Static Variables**
  - Belong to the class
  - Shared across all objects

**Key Takeaway:** Variable type directly affects memory usage and behavior.

## 🧹 Documentation & Maintenance Work

### 📘 README Polishing

- ✅ Continued improving README files of older repositories
- ✅ Worked inside VS Code for consistency
- ✅ Improved formatting and structure
- ✅ Clarified project descriptions
- ✅ Removed outdated or unclear content
- ✅ Ensured READMEs accurately represent the projects

---

## 🛠️ Work Breakdown

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Java Fundamentals** | Input/output streams, variables, casting |
| **Conceptual Learning** | Understanding Scanner and program flow |
| **Documentation** | README polishing and cleanup |
| **Maintenance** | Improving older repositories |

---

## ✅ What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- ✅ Scanner works on input streams, not magic
- ✅ `System.in`, `System.out`, and `System.err` serve distinct roles
- ✅ `next()` reads tokens, not full lines
- ✅ Variable scope defines accessibility and lifetime
- ✅ Type casting requires understanding data loss potential

### Professional Skills
- ✅ Documentation work improves project clarity
- ✅ Clean READMEs make repositories more presentable
- ✅ Maintenance days are productive, not wasted

---

## 🧠 Reflection

Today reinforced the importance of **foundational clarity**. Java concepts like input handling and variable scope may seem basic, but they directly impact how programs behave.

Pairing this learning with documentation cleanup ensured the day was productive even without heavy coding.

> **Fundamentals build everything on top. Clarity before complexity.**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Java Practice:**
- [ ] Practice Scanner input with small Java programs
- [ ] Write programs demonstrating different variable scopes
- [ ] Revise control statements and loops
- [ ] Build simple I/O-based applications

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Continue README standardization where needed
- [ ] Apply consistent formatting across all repos

## 📊 Session Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Focus Areas** | 2 (Java + Documentation) |
| **Java Topics Covered** | 4 core concepts |
| **READMEs Updated** | Multiple |
| **Code Written** | Minimal (focus on understanding) |
